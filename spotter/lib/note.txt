if you have two objectbox instances in a class then the second one won't open even if you open it the same way
the objectbox obj with the same file path (my assumption rn) is going to access the same set of data no matter which file you create it
You don't need to close the store while it's open unless there are a lot of background writing going on. ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68448935/whats-the-best-practice-to-close-the-store-instance-in-a-flutter-app
    Look in the small comments in the answer ^
You can use relations like sql to link objects together even though ObjectBox itself is a nosql db.
